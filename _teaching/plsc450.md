Teaching assistant for **PLSC 450 – Applied Entomology**.  
I graded assignments, provided detailed feedback, assisted in syllabus development, and created an original assignment introducing economic injury levels and economic thresholds.  

I delivered two guest lectures:

- **“Applied Entomology in Action: IPM and Tools for Growers”** (2024)  
- **“Applied Economic Thresholds”** (2025)
