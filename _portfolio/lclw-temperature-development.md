This research investigates how temperature affects development, survival, and phenology across all life stages of the lesser clover leaf weevil.

I conduct controlled environment experiments across temperatures from **5°C to 30°C** to quantify:

- instar-specific development times  
- pupation and emergence rates  
- survival curves at thermal extremes  
- developmental thresholds (lower/upper)  

These data support **pest forecasting models**, improving the timing of monitoring and management practices.
