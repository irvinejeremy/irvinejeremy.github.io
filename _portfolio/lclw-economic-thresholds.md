This project estimates economic injury levels (EILs) and economic thresholds (ETs) for the lesser clover leaf weevil (*Hypera nigrirostris*) in red clover (*Trifolium pratense*) seed production systems.

Using multi-year field trials, I measure:

- yield loss across a gradient of larval densities  
- plant damage relationships  
- seed production responses  
- cost-effective insecticide timing  

The goal is to provide growers with **quantitative, defensible thresholds** to guide management decisions and reduce unnecessary insecticide use.
