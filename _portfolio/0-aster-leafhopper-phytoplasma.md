This project examines how aster yellows phytoplasma (AYp) infection in canola (*Brassica napus* L.) affects the behavior and performance of its vector, the aster leafhopper (*Macrosteles quadrilineatus* Forbes).

Using two-choice and no-choice bioassays, we evaluated:

- settling preferences of AYp-infected and uninfected leafhoppers  
- nymph production and survival on AYp-infected vs uninfected *B. napus*  
- developmental performance on *B. napus* compared with a reference host, *Arabidopsis thaliana*  

At two weeks post-infection, leafhoppers showed a significant preference for AYp-infected plants, but this preference disappeared by four weeks. Uninfected leafhoppers produced significantly more nymphs on AYp-uninfected plants than on infected plants, yet overall survival on *B. napus* was poor and no individuals completed development. Phytoplasma titers increased over time and corresponded with symptom severity.

These results indicate that AYp infection briefly alters vector settling behavior, but *B. napus* is a marginal host that does not support full leafhopper development, with important implications for vector–pathogen dynamics and disease epidemiology in canola systems.
