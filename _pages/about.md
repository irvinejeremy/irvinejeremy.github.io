I am a Vanier Scholar and PhD student in the Department of Plant Sciences at the University of Saskatchewan. My research focuses on the chemical ecology and integrated management of insect pests in forage seed systems, especially in northern agricultural regions.

My work integrates field biology, chemical ecology, and applied entomology to support sustainable crop protection. I collaborate closely with growers, agronomists, and research partners to connect scientific discovery with real-world agricultural decision-making.

### Research interests  
- Economic thresholds & sampling plans for insect pests in red clover seed production  
- Temperature‐dependent development and climate change impacts on agricultural pests  
- Chemical ecology, host-location behavior, and semiochemical-based management tools  
- Undergraduate research experiences, teaching, and building inclusive scientific communities  

### About this site  
This website highlights my research, publications, teaching experience, outreach activities, and professional service. It is built using the AcademicPages template and hosted through GitHub Pages.
